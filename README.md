- Interested in behavior science and applying it to programming.
- Currently enrolled in Ethology Institute, pursuing a certificate in advanced applied ethology (animal training).
- Looking to collaborate on small video games of pretty much any kind. If you're an artist or musician that wants to do something cool, email me!

My first completed game: [Garlicnaut](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/960898643/)  
There's not really any depth to it, but it only took me like three days, for an assignment.

Great things to come!
